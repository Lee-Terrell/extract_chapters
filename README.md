Extracting chapters from an M4B file

## Objective
1. Take in an audiobook as an M4B file and break out the chapters into their own files
2. Generate a 16x16 pixel art image using the book title and chapter name

## Background
The Yoto Player is a screen-free smart speaker designed for children, featuring a minimalist 16x16 pixel art display for track identification. The device uses physical, credit-card-sized cards to deliver audiobooks, music, and educational content. Interaction is intuitive: children insert a card to play audio and remove it to pause, while large tactile knobs manage volume and track navigation. Yoto's Make Your Own card feature allows you to upload custom audio through their platform, create personalized 16x16 pixel art for individual tracks, and download the complete package to blank cards.
