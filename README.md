Extracting chapters from an M4B file

## Objective
The Yoto Player is a screen-free, kid-friendly smart speaker that uses physical, credit-card-sized cards to play audiobooks, music, and educational content. To use it, a child simply inserts a card into the device's top slot to start the audio and removes it to pause, while large tactile knobs control volume and track selection. Yoto offers a Make Your Own card feature where you can upload your own audio and download it to one of their blank cards. Audiobooks in an M4B file do not automatically break their chapters up into separate tracks for each chapter.
